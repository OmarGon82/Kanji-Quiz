Kanji-Quiz
Javascript Kanji quiz This is a kanji quiz I made to practice working with array and global variables. In the first unit of the Team Treehouse tech degree arrays and loops were covered. Part of the practice exercise was to build a simple quiz game. I really enjoyed working on it so I created a quiz game for Kanji. Since I live in Japan I thought it would be fun to use my quiz game to practice simple kanji.
